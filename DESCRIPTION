Description: Provides a simple tool to generate a continuous epidemiological week index from date variables in a dataframe. 
    The generate weeks are sequential and do not reset at calendar year boundaries.
    They are not ISO 8601 nor MMWR calendar weeks and are intended for epidemiological modeling, 
    times-series analysis, and nowcasting applications where temporal continuity is required.
